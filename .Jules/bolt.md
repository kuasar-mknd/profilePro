## 2025-03-05 - [Visibility/Animation State Conflict]
**Learning:** Overloading a single state variable (e.g., `isVisible`) to track both "element is in viewport" AND "animation loop is running" causes bugs. When the element settles (animation stops), the variable is set to false. If the viewport observer also relies on this variable, it might prevent the animation from restarting when the user interacts again.
**Action:** Use distinct variables for different state concerns (e.g., `isInViewport` vs `isAnimating`) or ensure the logic flow cleanly separates "permission to animate" (viewport) from "currently animating" (loop status).
