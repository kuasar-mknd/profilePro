## 2025-02-20 - Redundant Event Listeners in Component Interactions
**Learning:** When multiple components interact (e.g., Gallery and Lightbox), ensure event handling responsibilities are clearly defined to avoid duplication. I found that `ImageGallery` was adding a `keydown` listener to simulate clicks, while `Lightbox` was *also* listening for `keydown` globally. This caused double execution of the open logic and unnecessary event listener overhead.
**Action:** Centralize interaction logic in the controlling component (`Lightbox`) and keep UI components (`ImageGallery`) purely presentational where possible, relying on global delegation for interactions.
