## 2024-05-23 - Centralized Security Logic

**Vulnerability:** JSON-LD injection vulnerability where unescaped `<` characters could allow script injection.
**Learning:** Hardcoding security logic (like `.replace(/</g, '\\u003c')`) in multiple places increases the risk of inconsistencies and makes updates difficult. If one instance is missed or implemented incorrectly, the vulnerability remains.
**Prevention:** Centralize security logic in a dedicated utility (e.g., `src/utils/security.ts`) and use it consistently. This ensures a single source of truth for security controls and simplifies auditing.

## 2025-02-18 - Input Sanitization Enhancement

**Vulnerability:** Limited input sanitization allowed potential injection vectors using parentheses and brackets (e.g., function calls, template syntax).
**Learning:** Expanding sanitization to include '()', '[]', '{}' provides defense-in-depth against template injection and specific parser exploits without affecting visual rendering in HTML.
**Prevention:** Use the enhanced 'sanitizeInput' utility for all user-facing inputs.
