## 2024-05-23 - Pagination Localization & Icons
**Learning:** Pagination links ("Previous/Next") are often overlooked in localization. Standardizing them with `mdi` icons (arrow-left/right) and local language labels ("Précédent/Suivant") significantly improves the polish and usability for non-English users, especially when the rest of the site is localized.
**Action:** Always check pagination components in list views for localization and consistent icon usage. Use `text-pacamara-white` design token for hover states on dark buttons instead of generic `text-white`.
