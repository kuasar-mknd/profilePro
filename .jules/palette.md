**Learning:** Users on error pages need clear, comforting navigation paths. Text-only buttons can feel colder/broken compared to icon-rich primary navigation. Adding icons (Home, Back) provides visual anchors that reduce cognitive load during a stress state (getting a 404).
**Action:** When designing error states or empty states, always couple action buttons with recognizable icons to signal functionality and maintain design system consistency.

**Learning:** While "Skip to Content" is standard, users often need quick access to the footer for contact info, social links, or sitemap. Adding a "Skip to Footer" link alongside the standard skip link improves efficiency for keyboard users, especially on long pages like blog posts or portfolios.
**Action:** When implementing skip links, consider if a "Skip to Footer" link would benefit the user, especially if critical information resides there. Use a fixed container to stack multiple skip links cleanly.
