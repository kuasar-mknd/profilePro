# AI Policy & Roadmap

> **Note:** This document outlines the use of Artificial Intelligence in the development and content of this project.

## 🤖 Current AI Usage

- **Code Generation**: AI assistants (like Jules, GitHub Copilot) are used to assist in coding, testing, and documentation tasks.
- **Content Creation**: Project descriptions and summaries may be drafted with AI assistance, then reviewed by humans.
- **Optimization**: AI tools are used for image compression advice and code refactoring suggestions.

## 🚀 Roadmap: Local AI Integration

There is a planned feature to integrate a local AI model for generating dynamic project summaries.

### Architecture (Draft)
- **Model**: Small Language Model (SLM) capable of running in a browser or edge environment.
- **Goal**: Provide personalized content summaries without external API calls.
- **Privacy**: No user data will be sent to external AI APIs.

## ⚠️ Configuration

*Currently, no specific AI API keys are required for the deployed site.*
