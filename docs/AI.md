# AI Usage Policy

## Overview

This project prioritizes human creativity and coding. AI tools are used strictly as assistants for optimization, analysis, and repetitive tasks.

## Models & Configuration

- **Current Status**: No external AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) are integrated into the runtime of the application. The site is statically generated.
- **Development**: AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot or similar agents) may be used by developers to generate boilerplate code, write tests, or optimize algorithms.

## Content Generation

- **Text**: All project descriptions and blog posts are written by humans to ensure authenticity.
- **Images**:
  - Project images are real photographs/captures.
  - OG Images (Open Graph) are generated programmatically using `satori`, which uses HTML/CSS to draw images, not generative AI.

## Future Integration

If AI features are added in the future (e.g., for semantic search or chat), they must adhere to the following principles:
1. **Transparency**: Explicitly label AI-generated content.
2. **Privacy**: No user data sent to third-party models without consent.
3. **Cost Control**: Implement strict rate limiting and caching.
