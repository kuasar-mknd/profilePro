## Reporting a Vulnerability

The project team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please email the primary contact at `samuel@edulex.ch` with a detailed description of the issue, the steps to reproduce it, and any potential impact.

You can expect a response within 48 hours to acknowledge receipt of your report. We will work with you to understand and validate the issue. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a resolution has been reached.

We are committed to addressing security issues in a timely and responsible manner.
